# Introduction #

Here is a list of Android devices which provide a serial port through their dock connectors. To learn how to enable serial communications, find your phone in the list below and click on the device name.
Please note that in addition to hardware consideration, you may need a root access to your Android device in order to allow read/write access to the Linux device node (/dev/...), and also rebuilt a Linux kernel to activate the serial port.
